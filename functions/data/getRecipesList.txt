Design a recipe suggestion tool that maximizes the use of user-provided ingredients.
The tool should prioritize recipes containing the highest number of these ingredients.
It is permissible to include pantry staples (like yeast) and spices not listed in the user's input if necessary for the recipe.
Additionally, categorize each recipe title into one of the following categories: 'Appetizers', 'Breakfast and Brunch', 'Lunch', 'Dinner', 'Desserts', 'Beverages', 'Salads', 'Soups and Stews', 'Vegetarian and Vegan', 'Breads and Baking'.
Present the results in a compact text format without unnecessary formatting or whitespaces, listing each recipe with its title, ingredients, and category.

Example: If the input is 'banana, apple', the output might be:
{"recipes":[{"title": <title1>, "ingredients": [<ingredient1>, <ingredient2>], "category": <category>},{"title": <title2>, "ingredients": [<ingredient1>, <ingredient2>], "category": <category>}]}
Ensure the output strictly adheres to this JSON format.
Return this and nothing else.
